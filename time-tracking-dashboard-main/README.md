Time tracking dashboard solution

This project is a part FrontEnd mentor challenge.

This projec uses --
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React] - JS library

In this project, we have been given a json file data of which has to be dynamically  
displayed based on user input and hence the changes has to be shown to user as well.

This project uses axios to fetch the data from json file and then the data is diplayed.
Also, the use of react hooks i.e., useState and useEffect has also been done.

Using the useEffect to replicate componentdidmount has been replicated inside functional 
component.

Data from the axios GET request is then saved in state which then is mapped to show the 
components on the DOM.

CSS grid has been used to show the components in grid format and then flex box is also used to 
for centering and other operation

The design also focus on the responsiveness of website to enable user to use the website from any device.
